i3 setup
========

In Ubuntu 18.04, i3-gnome worked quite well.

With Ubuntu 20.04, however, things have changed significantly. i3-gnome-flashback
seems better, but has the following problems:

* When gnome-flashback is not running, gnome-control-center does not show any
  displays or Bluetooth adaptors.
  
* When gnome-flashback is running, the nm-applet icon disappears from i3 status bar.
  Other things /do/ appear there, so I don't know what the problem is
  
* The gnome-theme is pretty ugly, with big fonts and a big white border around gnome
  terminal.
